New generation 6 axis Motiontracking device 

The ICM-20608-G is the latest 6-axis device offered by InvenSense for the mass market. Compared to previous 6-axis devices, the ICM-20608-G offers lower power consumption, lower noise, and a thinner package. The ICM-20608-G offers a duty-cycled operation mode for the gyroscope, that reduces gyroscope power consumption by half or more (depending on ODR) compared to earlier 6-axis devices. It also provides about 20% lower noise than previous devices, and about 17% thinner package compared to previous devices.

The ICM-20608-G is a 6-axis MotionTracking device that combines a 3-axis gyroscope, and a 3-axis accelerometer in a small, 3 mm x 3 mm x 0.75 mm (16-pin LGA) package. It also features a 512-byte FIFO that can lower the traffic on the serial bus interface, and reduce power consumption by allowing the system processor to burst read sensor data, entering into a low-power mode. The ICM-20608-G, with its 6-axis integration, enables manufacturers to eliminate the costly and complex selection, qualification, and system level integration of discrete devices, guaranteeing optimal motion performance for consumers.
