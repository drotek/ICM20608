# ICM20608
New generation 6 axis Motiontracking device 

The ICM-20608-G is the latest 6-axis device offered by InvenSense for the mass market. Compared to previous 6-axis devices, the ICM-20608-G offers lower power consumption, lower noise, and a thinner package. The ICM-20608-G offers a duty-cycled operation mode for the gyroscope, that reduces gyroscope power consumption by half or more (depending on ODR) compared to earlier 6-axis devices. It also provides about 20% lower noise than previous devices, and about 17% thinner package compared to previous devices.
